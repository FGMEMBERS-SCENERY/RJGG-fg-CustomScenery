This custom scenery is intended to install RJGG Chubu Centrair Intl. Airport.
All of the modifications within this scenery packages are being also
updated in terrasync.

Importantly, DO NOT MERGE THE CONTENTS OF THIS SCENERY WITHIN YOUR TERRASYNC
SCENERY FOLDERS. There are many valid reasons for these. But to mention some:

1. Your terrasync may stop updating the area, or
2. Your next terrasync fetch may partially or totally reset the changes

To install, follow:

1. Verify that you posses a current git version

  a. MacOS or UNIX (LINUX) users
     $  git --version
  if a response indicating the version of git comes, then git is installed,
     otherwise install a current version of git for your system
  
  b. Windows users 
  Verify that you have a functional git version. Several packages exist. Any
  package with a GIT BASH function shall suffice.

2. Initial GIT cloning

  Open a terminal or a GIT BASH (Windows) terminal. 
  
  Create a folder for CustomScenery, ideally outside the Flightgear
  installation paths. Example (for UNIX like- or MacOS):

  $ mkdir /home/myname/FG_CustomScenery 

  To clone the GIT, change to such directory and inside execute the command

  [/home/myname/FG_CustomScenery]$> git clone  git@github.com:FGMEMBERS-SCENERY/RJGG-fg-CustomScenery.git

  You shall see information about RJGG-fg-customScenery being cloned, and once
  finished you should have the respective directory. This directory should
  have permissions set for the user to read, write and execute. This directory
  will reside inside your FG_CustomScenery

3. Updating your GIT

  When new changes occur to the version (such as updates), an update of your
  git directory needs to take place to fetch such changes locally. This is a
  disavantage to Terrasync's version, that updates automatically. But git
  updates will only download new or changed files reducing the size of
  subsequent downloads needed (as oppose to attempt getting the distribution
  as ZIP files)

  To update (pull) the git, open the terminal (or the git bash) and change to
  the directory created (RJGG-fg-CustomScenery).

  Then execute the pull command. If errors exist, double verify that you are
  executing the command inside the proper git directory (This is a common
  mistake)

  [/home/myname/FG_CustomScenery/RJGG-fg-CustomScenery]>$ git pull

4. Getting FGFS to recognize and use the Custom Scenery Folder

  This highly depends on how do you launch flightgear and a general
  instruction cannot effectively be provided but, keep in mind that you are
  trying to point FG to innitiate with this directory in the Scenery path

  a. Command line launching
  
 add --fg-scenery=/home/myname/FG_CustomScenery/RJGG-fg-CustomScenery (to your
 command line parameters; Make sure you are pointing to the right PATH)

  b. FGLauncher (Windows or Linux)

 The first page does include a position to list for Scenery Directories. Point
 to this directory, and give it a higher priority than any terrasync folder
 listed (if this one exist)

  c. FGLauncher (MacOS)

 Look for Install Add-On Packages and point to this directory. Then use Open
 Add-On packages to verify that everything is set correctly.


C. Oops I MERGED these to the terrasnc folders, because I did not know this
was inconvenient, or because I did wanted to see mayhem with my own eyes. 

To solve.

1. Go to your terrasync folder
2. Enter the Terrain folder and completely delete the subfolder e000n40
3. Go back to you terrasync folder
4. Enter the Objects folder and completely delete the subfolder e000n40
5. Relaunch flightgear into RJGG to re-download your terrasync packages cleanly

Have Fun Flying,
IH-COL 2015
