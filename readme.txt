INTRODUCTION
============

Chubu Centrair (RJGG) is classified as a first class airport and is the main international gateway for the Chubu ("central") region of Japan, and currently is counted among the Top-10 modern airports of the world. Chubu is an airport on an artificial island in Ise Bay, Tokoname City in Aichi Prefecture, 35 km (22 mi) south of Nagoya in central Japan.

Originally a single runway in the middle of the ocean in the default FlightGear terrain, I have now modeled and developed at a high level of detail and realism the main terminal (shaped like a "T"), the ATC tower and main hangars surrounding the airport. A second version consider to complete the rest of buildings present on the island. The terminal and main buildings have been animated with night textures, which complemented with lights and default 3D airplane models taken from FG package gives the airport a very realistic and fantastic night impression.

The main windows have been treated using real pictures to get a photorealistic effect of glass reflection. With the exception of the photographs used as an effect, all textures have been developed in a sole and exclusive work from scratch, adding bevels, shadows, lights, noise, color equalization and many other effects to get realism in each texture used.

The island terrain and surrounding coastline have been developed in an accordingly highly detailed level by Gijs de Rooy to complete the necesary elements to provide a great new airport for FlightGear, containing all internal roads and railways, which leaves the way open for future works on bridge, parking and other details of vehicular transport to and from the island.

- Junichi Suzuki: from "www.planepictures.net", for his fantastic and useful high resolution pictures taken on Chubu Centrair, and kindly sent by mail for a better use of them. For his generous assistance and help offered, and for the japanese text provided for "NAC" building, at Chubu.
